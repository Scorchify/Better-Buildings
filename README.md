# New-Better-Buildings

Better-Buildings is an app designed to report building issues to the school building services teams. This application allows users to submit detailed reports of any problems they encounter in school buildings and post them, ensuring that other students and school administration are aware of the issue. Administrators can adjust the default settings on the app to match their school's needs. <br/><br/>
New-Better Buildings is built with inspiration from Eric Matthes' webapp, Learning Log.
